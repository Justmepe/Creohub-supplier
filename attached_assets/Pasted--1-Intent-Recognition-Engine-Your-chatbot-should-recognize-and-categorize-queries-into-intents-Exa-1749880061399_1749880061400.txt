 1. Intent Recognition Engine
Your chatbot should recognize and categorize queries into intents. Example intents:

Intent	Example User Inputs
General Inquiry	"What is CreoHub?" "Tell me about this site"
Pricing Inquiry	"How much does it cost?" "What are your pricing plans?"
Feature Inquiry	"What can I do with CreoHub?" "Do you support e-commerce?"
Account Help	"I can’t log in" "How do I create an account?"
Technical Support	"I’m getting an error" "App won’t load"
Integration Query	"Can I connect with Stripe?" "Do you support Zapier?"
Use Case Guidance	"How can I sell digital products?" "Can I use this for my course?"
Setup Guidance	"How do I start?" "Guide me through the setup"
Contact/Live Support	"I want to talk to someone" "Help me with a complex issue"

🧠 2. Core Knowledge Base / FAQ Layer
Build predefined responses using knowledge from CreoHub’s content, such as:

💡 What is CreoHub?
"CreoHub is an all-in-one platform for creators to sell digital products, manage e-commerce, memberships, and automation — without coding."

💰 Pricing Plans
"We offer flexible pricing: a free tier with basic tools, and premium plans with advanced features like automations, integrations, and custom branding. Want a detailed breakdown?"

(Then list pricing or link to pricing page.)

🔧 Key Features
"You can create digital stores, manage memberships, sell courses, offer subscriptions, and integrate third-party tools like Stripe, PayPal, and Zapier."

🔄 3. Dynamic Response Flow Logic
This gives the chatbot a "smart" feeling. Here’s how it can respond logically:

A. Conditional Response Based on Context
User: “Can I sell ebooks on CreoHub?”
Bot:

"Yes! You can upload and sell digital products like eBooks, courses, templates, or music. Want me to walk you through setting up your first product?"

→ If yes, trigger step-by-step guide flow.

B. Smart Follow-Up Questions
User: “I need help creating a store”
Bot:

"Sure! Are you setting up a store for:
1️⃣ Digital products
2️⃣ Memberships
3️⃣ Courses
4️⃣ Something else?"
(Based on selection, route to a tutorial or onboarding flow.)

📡 5. Integration Responses
When a user asks about tools like Stripe, PayPal, or marketing integrations:

User: “Can I integrate with Stripe?”
Bot:

"Yes! We support Stripe, PayPal, and more. Head to your dashboard > Settings > Payments to connect your account. Want me to send the direct link?"

🛑 6. Fallback + Human Support Trigger
If the bot is stuck or user is confused:

"Hmm, I didn't quite get that. You can type your question again or contact support. Need human help?"

🔐 7. Authentication-Aware Logic (if linked to user accounts)
If integrated with user accounts (via cookies/session):

Detect logged-in user

Customize help based on their plan or activity

Example:

User: “I can’t publish my product”
Bot:

"I see you’re on the free plan — publishing is limited to 1 product. Upgrade your plan to publish more!"

🧩 8. Error/Issue Diagnostic Tree
For bugs and errors:

User: “My payment isn’t going through”
Bot:

"Sorry about that! Is this happening with:
